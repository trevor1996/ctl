Q(1): Have you been charged with an offense in the state of Hawaii? 
A: No
	Q(1.1):GOTO:nomore
A: Yes
	Q(house): How many people are in your household?
	X:number
		Q(income): How much income does your household bring in per year?
		X:number
			Q(1.2.1.1): Are you facing a civil or criminal matter?
			A[javascript:if (fedpov(getvar('house'),getvar('income'),150)){ goto('qualciv') } else { goto('noqualciv') } ]: Civil
			A[javascript:if (fedpov(getvar('house'),getvar('income'),150)){ goto('qualcrim') } else { goto('noqualcrim') } ]: Criminal


Q(qualciv): You probably qualify as indigent since you earn less than 150% of the poverty line. 

Q(qualcrim): You probably qualify as indigent since you earn less than 150% of the poverty line. So you'll likely be assigned a lawyer by the judge. See <a href="http://www.mass.gov/courts/case-legal-res/rules-of-court/sjc/sjc310.html" target=_new>SJC Rule 3:10</a>.

Q(noqualciv): You probably won't qualify as indigent since you earn more than 150% of the poverty line. 

Q(noqualcrim): You probably won't qualify as indigent since you earn more than 150% of the poverty line.

Q(nomore): I'm afraid there's nothing else I can help you with. I hope you have a nice day.
